            <h1>The Genesis</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Circa 2022, I was just a 16 year old boy who had finished writing his <em>WASSCE</em> and was at home with little idea of what to do as I just went to school because I had to. A breakthrough arrived a couple of months later as I got employed in a tech organization called <strong>EMEZAK LTD</strong>. This was where my tech skills would get honed and sharpened to lead me to where I am today.</p>

            <h2>Early Days</h2> <!-- Getting Used to Corporate Tech Lifestyle-->
            <p>I started in September of that year. I was taken through a series of speed tests to ensure I would be up to speed for the vigorous work ahead of me. Poor me, I had no idea what I just gotten into. I began a day or two later first given minimal tasks of some 20 accounts to register and activate with little pressure but simply an urge to focus on improving my typing speed. With time, I became better and soon enough, I was doing 50 accounts a day. I was under 3 purchasers so in a day, I could register and activate up to 150 accounts before leaving the office....and I did this every week.</p>
            <br><p>It stopped being rosy when the sites we used for registration and activation began to see an increase in latency as they were jammed by other users who were also trying to do the same things as ours. Closing time began to extend from 4pm to 5pm and next thing we knew, we were staying behind till 7pm to finish our work for the day so it didn't get added to the next day's tasks. Network issues also began to pop in with our WiFi running out much quicker than it normally would and we had to dip in our own pockets to buy data to work. But we had passion for the job we were doing so we did it with minimal fuss and we adjusted to that issue as well till things began to get better a little. I began to get even faster with the computer; I could type passages in minutes, switching between tabs without even looking at the keyboard. I felt a rush of being somewhat godlike each time I worked as I was impressed with the speed I had developed.</p>

            <h3>Forays Into Design</h3>
            <p>The guys in the office with me were taking programming courses to gain extra skills. I wasn't sure I could do it as I still felt very green and wasn't ready to hop into the world of high-level programming languages and so I spoke to one of the guys and he taught me the basics of graphic design with the use of Canva. Fred made me watch a video on a simple design and he guided me to make one of my own. Feeling empowered, I made it a point to finish my work much quicker so I could practice my graphic design more.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I made designs for beach parties, shopping discounts and a whole lot all from blank spaces with zero templates. Always being an ambitious person, an idea began to creep into my head over time. <em>"This isn't enough. What if we could somehow make these pictures more engaging? Maybe get them to move a bit?".</em> I began exploring Canva even further and I discovered the parts of it which enabled video editing. This was where I taught myself video editing. Yes, the boy who came into this company with only loads of potential was now about to teach himself video editing, I chuckled to myself. I began with picking videos off social media platform Twitter, I would pick 15-second to 30-seconds clips and combine them together with a little animation and editing. Next thing I knew, I was designing posters and then animating them so a simple graphic design would now become a video animation. I showed my work to my colleagues at the office and they couldn't be more proud.</p>
            <p>The best work I ever did was a video ad I made for <em>Cyril Selase(CEO of Excel Business Consult)</em> where I did a video ad of just over a minute which addressed the viewer's need for an excellent graphic designer and the video eventually transitioned into showing his work and closing with his contact details for interested potential customers, all over an excellent background music which automatically gets whoever is watching the ad to feel relaxed which can be found which you can see <a href="videos/selase refix.mp4" target="_blank">here</a>
. He was so proud that till this day in 2025, He still reposts it occasionally. Once I had done this, as insatiable as I'm sure you could tell I am by now, I began seeking a new challenge.</p>

            <h4>Programming(Present Day)</h4>
            <p>I knew what I would do now, I was going to become a programmer and I would be a self-taught one at that. Around this time, I got promoted to join the purchasers except there was one tiny problem, albeit not one I couldn't handle, I had to work at midnight. Adjusting from working in the day to sleeping during the day and working at night was rough but I pulled through eventually. My work began at 2am and so at 12am, I'd start learning HTML and CSS online and that was how I became familiar with programming. By the time I was ready to go to the university, I was: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A graphic designer</li>
                <li>A video editor</li>
                <li>A computer savvy young man at the age of 19</li>
                <li>A programming prodigy.</li>
            </ul>  
            <p>My study of these two languages(debatable as most people don't see them as programming languages) would later serve as a great foundation for me when I later went to the university as I was already familiar with the syntax of programming ensuring I always aced my programming in C++ lessons.</p>
